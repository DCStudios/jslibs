# JsLibs

### What is it?
JsLibs is a set of javascript libraries I made and use in my projects.

### List of the libraries
- **Transition.js**:<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simple library to create single-page applications.
	More precisely, to add delays before and after page load to enable transition animations.
	Uses jQuery 2.1.4 and ajax.

- **Task.js**:<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simple library that transforms a div into a full task manager.
	Task are placed inside lists, and can be dragged from one list to another.
	Useful to keep up with tasks and manage what's next to do and what is left to do after!

**Controls**:<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Group of javascript controls to boost page effiency.
	- _Combobox_: A dropdown of options, triggers the 'changed' event.
	- _Accordeon_: A simple open/close toggler.
